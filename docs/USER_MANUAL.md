## 1. Introduction

### What is Iron Stag?

Iron Stag is an AI-powered deer analysis application designed for hunters, wildlife enthusiasts, and deer management professionals. Using advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning, Iron Stag analyzes photos of deer to provide:

- **Age Estimation** - Estimated age of the deer in years
- **Sex Identification** - Buck or Doe classification
- **Species Type** - Whitetail or Mule Deer identification
- **Antler Analysis** - Point count (left and right antlers separately)
- **Body Condition Assessment** - Overall health evaluation
- **Harvest Recommendation** - AI-powered HARVEST or PASS recommendation
- **Confidence Score** - How certain the AI is about its analysis

### Supported Deer Species

Iron Stag is specifically designed for:
- ✅ **Whitetail Deer**
- ✅ **Mule Deer**

The app will **not** analyze:
- ❌ Elk
- ❌ Moose
- ❌ Other wildlife (hogs, turkey, etc.)
- ❌ Non-animal images

If you upload an image that isn't a Whitetail or Mule Deer, the app will notify you and no scan will be used.

## 11. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Analysis Failed"
**Possible causes:**
- Poor internet connection
- Image too large
- Server temporarily unavailable

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try a smaller/compressed image
3. Wait a moment and try again

- Account doesn't exist
